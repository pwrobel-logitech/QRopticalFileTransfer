    <string name="privpolicy_tilte">Privacy Policy</string>
    <string name="privacypolicy1">
        The privacy policy for this app can be found under this link, but it is also presented here below:
        \n\n
        \tThis application does not collect any of your data. It only uses the camera to capture
        the stream of QR frames in order to recreate as a file. So it needs camera system permission and
        both the permission to read and write to the file storage - only to do the file transmission.
        No other usage of files occurs other than to do the transmission.\n\n

        This application also requires permission for system setting write. It only needs to use those system settings permission
        in order to brighten up the screen at the time when file is being transmitted as a stream of QR frames and
        go back to original brightness after it has finished - that lets the receiver camera pick up the image more easily.
        No other system settings other than this brightness manipulation are changed.\n\n


        This app uses the Google\'s advertisement services to display the advertisement banner in its free version.
        It might collect some of your data - see the Google privacy policy to know more.
        In order to use this ad service, this app in its free
        version requires permission for the network - it does not transmits other data through the network other than what
        is needed for the Google\'s advertisement service.
        In the non-free version, the network permissions are
        not necessary, since there is no ads then.

        Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
        I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
\n\n
        This application can also request some action from other applications, like opening a file by some external application.
        No information other than query terms are passed to the intent then (like in the case of opening a file or link, only the
        link or file path and mimetype is passed to the external application - nothing else) - so the privacy policy of this external apps
        should be looked up then.

        Optical file transfer is application that uses stream of QR frames to transfer files between
        phones and from desktop PC to phone - see the uploader in web browser(Firefox, Chrome) version, or the native Windows and Linux complementary applications for file upload from
        desktop PC.

    <string name="textabout2">
    \n
       <i>Advantages</i> \n
        <big><b>\u2022</b></big> Minimal preparations required once parameters are tweaked - just point the camera on the QR stream and wait for the file to transfer.\n
        <big><b>\u2022</b></big> Fully off-line - no network setup at all.\n
        <big><b>\u2022</b></big> It is wireless and does emit little RF noise to the environment, compared to WiFi or BT - so you can do
        wireless file transmission while the phones are in the airplane mode and you do not have infrared port in any of them.

        \n\n
        <i>Disadvantages</i> \n
        <big><b>\u2022</b></big> It is very slow, so only reasonable for small files.\n
        <big><b>\u2022</b></big> Does not have any guarantee
        to finish - requires initial tweaking of transmission settings on the producer side
        to get optimal transmission speed while keeping errors/noise below the threshold.\n
        <big><b>\u2022</b></big> Affected by noise such as sun reflexes, low brightness on producer side or inability for
        the camera to focus for prolonged time.\n
